Electric Motor Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning
Electric Motor Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning is a predictive maintenance solution aimed at forecasting the temperature of electric motors in industrial settings. By analyzing historical operational data such as motor load, voltage, current, and environmental conditions, combined with machine learning algorithms, this project aims to predict motor temperatures accurately. The goal is to prevent overheating, avoid equipment failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve overall operational efficiency.

Scenario 1: Preventive Maintenance
Manufacturing plants can use the temperature predictions to implement proactive maintenance strategies. By identifying potential overheating issues before they occur, maintenance teams can schedule timely inspections, replace worn-out components, and prevent costly downtime due to motor failures.

Scenario 2: Energy Efficiency
Facility managers can leverage temperature predictions to optimize energy consumption. By maintaining motors at optimal temperature levels, they can reduce energy wastage, improve equipment performance, and lower operational costs over time.

Scenario 3: Equipment Reliability
Industries relying heavily on electric motors, such as automotive production or HVAC systems, can benefit from accurate temperature predictions. Ensuring motors operate within safe temperature ranges enhances equipment reliability, prolongs lifespan, and minimizes the risk of unexpected breakdowns during critical operations.
